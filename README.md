# House-Prediction-Model-Using-Linear-Regression

### This project uses linear regression to predict the price of a house. The project is divided into the following steps:
1.Data preparation: The data is prepared by cleaning it and removing any errors or outliers.<br>
2.Feature engineering: The features in the data are engineered to make them more useful for the model.<br>
3.Model selection: The best model for the data is selected.<br>
4.Model training: The model is trained on the data.<br>
5.Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test data.<br>

### The project uses the following Python libraries:
1.NumPy<br>
2.Pandas<br>
3.Scikit-Learn<br>
4.Myplotlib<br>
5.Seaborn<br>

### The project can be run by following these steps:
1.Clone the repository.<br>
2.Install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.<br>
3.Run the Linear Regression.py file.<br>

### The project will output the following:
1.The accuracy of the model on the test data.<br>
2.The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model on the test data.<br>
3.The mean absolute error (MAE) of the model on the test data.<br>
