# House-Presiction-Model-Using-Linear-Regression

### This project uses linear regression to predict the price of a house. The project is divided into the following steps:
1.Data preparation: The data is prepared by cleaning it and removing any errors or outliers.
2.Feature engineering: The features in the data are engineered to make them more useful for the model.
3.Model selection: The best model for the data is selected.
4.Model training: The model is trained on the data.
5.Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test data.

### The project uses the following Python libraries:
1.NumPy
2.Pandas
3.Scikit-Learn
4.Myplotlib
5.Seaborn

### The project can be run by following these steps:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3.Run the main.py file.

### The project will output the following:
1.The accuracy of the model on the test data.
2.The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model on the test data.
3.The mean absolute error (MAE) of the model on the test data.
